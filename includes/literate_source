literate_source () { # Allows heredoc-level substitutions for any string either through stdin or as a function argument.
  # envsubst only does variable substitution
  # heredocs and quotes do variable substitution/expansion and process substitution
  # source (.) does the above and treats everything else as code too.
  # the name comes from language systems that invert comments and code for executable blog posts (ie, like Literate Haskell)
