# envsubst only does variable substitution
# heredocs and quotes do variable substitution/expansion and process substitution
# source (.) does the above and treats everything else as code too.
# This targets heredoc-level substitutions to complete the set of quoting options.
# The name comes from language systems that invert comments and code for executable blog posts (ie, like Literate Haskell)

literate_source () { # Allows heredoc-level substitutions for any string either through stdin or as a function argument.
  printf 'echo "%s"' "${@:-$(</dev/stdin)}" | . /dev/stdin
}
