# VCLODs: Variable Configuration Locking Operation Destination Scripts

## What are VCLODs?

An open-source directory based ksh framework to productionize programs from
component scripts

## What are the benefits?
* Build from simple scripts
* Encoding Timing and Configuration in script absolute path, allows complex
  behavior
* Automatic human readable process reporting
* Connections are easy (see the connections/ directory)
  * InfluxDB, MongoDB, Redis, Postgres would be easy to add
  * MySQL/MariaDB, MSSQL already implemented
* Use your own language (shebang) - JavaScript/Node, Ruby, Go
* Scripts/programs can focus on their purpose without dealing with their
  infrastructure
* Fast dev, Fast execution, Dev mobility, Extensibility - Especially for Data
  tasks
  * ~500 C program lines convert to 14 VCLODs lines
  * At a glance debugging

## How does it work?
* ~200 ksh lines that provide...
* Modularizing simple scripts/programs to automate ~95% of the boilerplate
  needed to productionize
  * Configuration
  * Locking
  * Logging
  * Alerting
  * Timing (cron over directories)
    * Precedence (alpha order)
    * Parallelization
  * Database Connections
  * Piped Operations: Batching, Alerting, Advanced Logging ...

sh         | Producer ^2 | 0             | Source a ksh script                            |
py         | Producer    | optional      | Run either stdin or file as python3            |
shebang    | Producer    | 0             | Respect script's shebang                       |
sql        | Producer    | 0             | Run a SQL script with default connection       |
dst        | Producer    | 0             | Run A SQL script with the secondary connection |
diff       | Consumer ^3 | 1             | diff stdout:file                               |
err        | Consumer    | 0             | Everything is an error                         |
out        | Consumer    | 1             | Write to file; stop                            |
outa       | Consumer    | 1             | Append to file; stop                           |
add        | Pipe ^4     | 1             | Prepend stdin with file                        |
awk        | Pipe        | 1             | run stdout through awk file                    |
batch ^5   | Pipe        | 0             | aggregate input to batch statement             |
end        | Pipe        | 1             | Postpend stdin with file                       |
tee        | Pipe        | 1             | Route output to file and continue              |

1. Extra File means the extension can use an extension option
   (`<extension>-<filename>`) as either input (diff), code, or output. filename
   defaults to the basename of the script. The directory the extra is in
   defaults to the same directory as the script, but often can be overridden. py
   allows the extra file to have an extension if it is in a different directory,
   otherwise, the extra file may not have its own extension or it will be run as
   if it was a VCLODScript
2. Producers can also consume pipes, but they don't need to
3. Consumers require a Producer. `out` and `outa` end pipes; other Consumers can
   be Producers
4. Pipes requires a Producer AND Consumer
5. batch runs `vclod_batcher`. See vclod_batcher commands below

## What is the Strategy?

* Accommodating lazy Database Programmers ;)
* Prioritizing work done over copy paste boilerplate

## What are the Objections?
* Unnecessary!! I don't need this brain pain!!
  * Copy-and-paste is always an option. As well as re-debugging.
  * Since you have to run shell anyways, make it do the common, critical tasks
    so that you don't have to re-implement them every time you add a new
    language to your tech stack

* python3 > ksh
  * ok, so use python inside VCLODs. Productionization is free
  * Shell scripting is the universal language

### vclod_batcher commands:

Command    | default if start exists | description                                                              |

#del_end   | ');'                    | delete statement end                                                     |
#RESET     |                         | reset to start state so you can start a new batch in the same pipe       |

# How VCLODs work

## Configuration

There is a global config file to make life easier (`/etc/vclods`), then each
directory has its own configs to fine tune what all the scripts in a given
directory will do

## Locking

Each script file automatically locks out redundant execution (or allows up to
`VCLOD_BATCH_JOBS` number of instances to run).

## Operation

Based on the file extension list, different operations can be assigned. If the
extension is `.sh` then it is sourced as a ksh script. If the extension is
`.sql` then it is passed as sql to the primary sql connection. Extensions are
recursively applied, so `.dst.sql` will run sql on the primary database
connection, then pipe the output into the secondary database connection,
effectively making it a metasql script.

## Destination

Log output (anything in stdout at pipe's end) can go to 5 locations:

Control     | Where               | Description                                                                                                              |
------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Always      | log files           | in $LOG_BASE_DIR and $VCLOD_ERR_DIR                                                                                      |
Always      | syslog              | This can be pulled in by systems like graylog and datadog                                                                |
Conditional | email               | stderr goes to email ($OPERATIONS_EMAIL) for alerting                                                                    |
Optional    | stdout              | if you are manually running the script in a terminal                                                                     |
Optional    | post process script | As defined in $LOG_POST_PROCESS. The provided post process script (vclod_pp_log2sql) logs to SQL for relational querying |

## Pseudocode Examples: Note `.` is shorthand for `|` so VCLODScript names are self-descriptive

* For more examples, look in this repo's test directory. Output is compared to
  `test/expected`
* script.sh: run a script in directory context (VCLODs handles Timing,
  Configuration, Locking, Logging, ...)
* script.sql.sh: script.sh except it spits out SQL to avoid connection call
* script.sh.sql: a query generates a shell script (usually curl)
* script.sh.tee-file.sql: script.sh.sql except shell commands go to file for
  analysis
* script.err.diff-file.\*: run something, compare output with file, and if diff
  treat as error + send email
* script.dst.sql: run a query on primary connection that generates a query for
  secondary connection (data migration)
* script.sql.tee-file.batch.sql: run a query, batch the output, stash batched
  statements into a file for auditing, run generated batch statements

## Example Crontab

Specify when you want which directories to run and then everything in them run

```
44 4 1 1 *   /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/yearly/
15 2 1 * *   /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/monthly/
7  1 * * Sun /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/weekly/
7  1 * * Fri /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/fridays/
7  1 * * Wed /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/wednesdays/
3  6 * * *   DEBUG_SHOULD_TIME_IT=1 VCLOD_JOBS=5 /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/nightly/
30 4 * * *   DEBUG_SHOULD_TIME_IT=1 VCLOD_JOBS=2 /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/0430_nightly/
6 0,8-23/2 * * * /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/bihourly/
22 * * * *   /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/hourly/
*  * * * *   /usr/local/bin/vclod /vclod/minutely/
```

## Example Directory Structure

```
/vclod/nightly/
/vclod/nightly/config
/vclod/nightly/script1.sh
/vclod/nightly/server_database/
/vclod/nightly/server_database/config: configures `VCLOD_HOST`/`VCLOD_DB`
/vclod/nightly/server_database/script2.sql
/vclod/nightly/server_database/script3.dst.sql
```

# Testing

1. Setup the `./test/config` file to have the right mysql permissions. Do not
   commit said credentials, though those belong in `/etc/vclods`
2. `./run_test.sh` - confirms that the proper log files are generated with the
   right contents; checks syslog; outputs the contents of the log files and
   syslog for visual comparison
3. `./run_test.sh | cat` - does the same thing, but with no output except on
   test error
